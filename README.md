# Using the installation scripts
To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root.
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noimc/javaandbedrock/refs/heads/main/load.sh)
```
Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command.

Here is a YouTube video that illustrates the installation process.
